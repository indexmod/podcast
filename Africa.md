The School of Biological Science and Technology in the College of Science and Technology is a new school dedicated to the learning of theory and applications of natural life forms and life phenomena. It consists of two science courses (Course in Biosystems and Course in Aquatic Biology and Environmental Science), which aim to unlock the secrets of life, and one engineering course (Bioengineering Course), which attempts to create bio-based products and technology that improve human life. At first, all of this school’s students study the fundamental knowledge and technology of both science and engineering. Then, they learn about highly specialized knowledge and technology in detail, after choosing one of the three courses. The curriculum of this school emphasizes professional education based on extensive experiments and exercises for cultivating independent, creative, and collaborative minds. In addition, through the teaching of academic presentation, the school is expected to produce creative scientists, engineers, and educators who can pursue the essence of life and apply it to the realization of an affluent human society. Course in Biosystems involves biological research carried out from various aspects, and provides a broad education in fundamental fields of biology ranging from molecules and cells to individual organisms and ecosystems. Course in Aquatic Biology and Environmental Science provides a broad education for applying knowledge of marine organisms, biological resources, and environmental science to the technology required by society. Course in Bioengineering produces engineers who have a wide knowledge of bioengineering and are highly skilled at solving problems.
